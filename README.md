INSPIRATION
we wanted to do something we would all be equally passionate about creating, despite our varying skill levels. sam wrote the fateful message "game. with Story [sic]," and the rest is history. gws is also inspired by undertale, you are baba, the rusty lake series, social anxiety disorder, and our experiences as college freshmen.

WHAT IT DOES
play as a college freshman who's been putting off unpacking for...a normal amount of time. hang up posters!! unrepress your emotions!! and at long last, touch grass!!
